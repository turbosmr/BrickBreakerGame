## About:

This was my second game project for my CSC 613 at SFSU. It was coded in Java, using OOP. I reused a lot of the code from my first game project.

How to play the game:

* The goal of Super Rainbow Reef is to destroy all of the Biglegs by bouncing Pop off of Katch.
* Pop looks like a Starfish and Katch is always located at the bottom of the screen.
* The Biglegs look like Octopus and are located at the top of the screen.
* Pop is affected by gravity and will fall off the screen if Katch isn’t under him to bounce him back up.
* Katch is controlled by the player and can move left and right across the screen. 
* There are Coral Defenses Pop has to break through to get to the Biglegs. Each time Pop hits a Coral Defense they will be destroyed. 
* Each time Pop falls off the bottom of the screen, he will lose a life. 
* Pop has three lives total. After all lives are gone, the game is over and you lose.
* Pop will increase in speed each time he bounces off of Katch.
* Pop’s speed will reset to the next levels set speed after a level has been completed.
* Each level has a slightly faster set speed.
* There are five level to complete. Levels are completed each time Pop destroys all of the Biglegs on the screen. After all of the Biglegs are destroyed, the game is over and you win.
* At the bottom of the screen there is a display for the score, current level, current lives of Pop, and the speed of Pop.
